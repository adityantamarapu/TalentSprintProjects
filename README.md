The following are the list of small projects I worked on at TalentSprint:
1. Box game: 
    Play the box game by opening the [view/startGame.html](https://adityantamarapu.github.io/TalentSprintProjects/TalentSprint/view/startGame.html) on the browser.
    The game is about running away from the boxes that chase the mouse pointer.
    The game ends when the boxes catch the mouse pointer.

3. Todo bubbles app: 
    This is a todo list app that supports the regular list view and a fun bubbles view.
    Toggle between views.
