The following are the list of small projects I worked on at TalentSprint:
1. Box game
    Play the box game by opening the view/startGame.html on the browser.
    The game is about running away from the boxes that chase the mouse pointer.
    The game ends when the boxes catch the mouse pointer.

2. Todo bubbles app
    This is a todo list app that supports the regular list view and a fun bubbles view.
    Toggle between views.
    Open view/todoGPT.html on the browser to check it out.
