The following are the list of small projects I worked on at TalentSprint:
1. Box game
    Play the box game by opening the [view/startGame.html](https://adityantamarapu.github.io/TalentSprintProjects/TalentSprint/view/startGame.html) on the browser.
    The game is about running away from the boxes that chase the mouse pointer.
    The game ends when the boxes catch the mouse pointer.

2. Todo bubbles app
    This is a todo list app that supports the regular list view and a fun bubbles view.
    Toggle between views.
    Open [view/todoGPT.html](https://adityantamarapu.github.io/TalentSprintProjects/TalentSprint/view/todoGPT.html) on the browser to check it out.

3. Snake game with muli player support
   Play the classic snake game solo or with another player on the same LAN.
   Used socket.io to set up two client-server connections.
   Download the snake_game folder from [TalentSprintProjects/TalentSprint](https://adityantamarapu.github.io/TalentSprintProjects/TalentSprint/) and
   run server.js file.
   Requires to have Node.js installed.
