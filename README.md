The following are the list of small projects I worked on at TalentSprint:
1. Box game: 
    Play the box game by opening the [view/startGame.html](https://adityantamarapu.github.io/TalentSprintProjects/TalentSprint/view/startGame.html) on the browser.
    The game is about running away from the boxes that chase the mouse pointer.
    The game ends when the boxes catch the mouse pointer.

3. Todo bubbles app: 
    This is a todo list app that supports the regular list view and a fun bubbles view.
    Toggle between views.
    Open [view/todoGPT.html](https://adityantamarapu.github.io/TalentSprintProjects/TalentSprint/view/todoGPT.html) on the browser to check it out.

4. Snake game with muli player support: 
   Play the classic snake game solo or with another player on the same LAN.
   Used socket.io to set up two client-server connections.   
   Requires to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed.
   Download the snake_game folder from [TalentSprintProjects/TalentSprint](https://github.com/adityantamarapu/TalentSprintProjects/tree/main/TalentSprint).
   Run "npm install" to load dependencies and "node server.js" in the command line from the downloaded snake_game directory to play.
